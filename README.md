## Project Setup and Contribution Guidelines (Tailwind CSS, SCSS, Locomotive Scroll, GSAP, ScrollTrigger)

This project utilizes a modern frontend tech stack for building a smooth and interactive web experience. Here's how you can contribute and maintain code quality:

**Tech Stack:**

- Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- SCSS (preprocessor for Sass)
- JavaScript (primary scripting language)
- Locomotive JS (smooth scrolling library)
- GSAP (powerful animation library)
- ScrollTrigger (GSAP plugin for scroll-based animations)

**Contribution Workflow:**

1. **Branching:**
    - Create a new branch from `main` for adding a new feature. This isolates your development and prevents unintended changes in the main codebase.
2. **Implement your Functionality:**
    - Use Tailwind CSS for utility classes and SCSS for more complex styling.
    - Write clean and well-commented JavaScript code.
    - Leverage Locomotive JS, GSAP, and ScrollTrigger for smooth interactions and animations.
3. **Testing and Code Review:**
    - Thoroughly test your changes to ensure no regressions.
    - Consider using a linter to enforce code style conventions and identify potential issues.
4. **Merging:**
    - Once you're confident about your code, create a pull request to merge your feature branch into `main`. This allows for code review and discussion before integration.

**Code Maintainability:**

- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive variable and function names to improve readability.
- **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious sections of code.
- **Modular Components:** Wherever possible, break down functionalities into reusable components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for better organization and maintainability.

**Additional Tips:**

- Feel free to discuss features or technical questions with other contributors before starting development.
- We can explore using a linter or code formatter to ensure consistent code style.

**Remember:** By following these guidelines, we can build a beautiful, performant, and well-structured web application.
